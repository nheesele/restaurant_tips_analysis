This project aims to use the restaurant tips dataset to practice creating composition plots and visualizations. Then examine the relationship between different variables and the tips given. 

The dataset consists of information from 244 restaurant bills, collected in the US in 1987. It includes details about the tips given to restaurant staff, such as the total bill, tip amount, gender of the person paying, smoking status, day of the week, time of day, and party size.

## Data Souce:

The dataset is sourced from Seaborn's sample datasets, which are included for educational and demonstration purposes.
